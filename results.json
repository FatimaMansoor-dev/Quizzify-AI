    "given_answer": "False",
    "is_correct": false,
    "source": "The human brain is the central organ of the nervous system, and with the spinal cord, comprises the central nervous system."

    "question": "2. The human brain is responsible for only motor control.",
    "given_answer": "False",
    "is_correct": true,
    "source": "The brain controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the information it receives from the sensory nervous system. The brain integrates sensory information and coordinates instructions sent to the rest of the body."

    "question": "3. The blood-brain barrier is responsible for blood drainage.",
    "given_answer": "False",
    "is_correct": true,
    "source": "The larger arteries throughout the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries. These smallest of blood vessels in the brain, are lined with cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to the same degree as they do in other capillaries; this creates the blood\u2013brain barrier."

  {
    "question": "4. The human brain is responsible for regulating body temperature.",
    "given_answer": "True",
    "is_correct": true,
    "source": "The hypothalamus also plays a role in thermal regulation, and when stimulated by the immune system, is capable of generating a fever."

  {
    "question": "5. The human brain is the only organ that can regenerate itself.",
    "given_answer": "False",
    "is_correct": true,
    "source": "The human brain is primarily composed of neurons, glial cells, neural stem cells, and blood vessels."

  {
    "question": "6. The human brain is responsible for processing sensory information.",
    "given_answer": "True",
    "is_correct": true,
    "source": "The sensory nervous system is involved with the reception and processing of sensory information."

  {
    "question": "7. The human brain is responsible for controlling emotions.",
    "given_answer": "False",
    "is_correct": false,
    "source": "The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insular cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared to be involved in generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience."

  {
    "question": "8. The human brain is responsible for processing language.",
    "given_answer": "True",
    "is_correct": true,
    "source": "While language functions were traditionally thought to be localised to Wernicke's area and Broca's area, it is now mostly accepted that a wider network of cortical regions contributes to language functions."

  {
    "question": "9. The human brain is responsible for controlling motor functions.",
    "given_answer": "True",
    "is_correct": true,
    "source": "The motor system of the brain is responsible for the generation and control of movement."

  {
    "question": "10. The human brain is responsible for regulating blood pressure.",
    "given_answer": "False",
    "is_correct": false,
    "source": "Blood pressure and heart rate are influenced by the vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest."
